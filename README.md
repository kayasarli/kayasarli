I am really into sports, I enjoy playing basketball and espacially football.
I even love watching and also playing video games about sports.

CS 50 Course:

As a subtitle of the lesson that I am taking, AP CSP, I have watched and learned a bunch of new stuff from the CS50 course. 
I basically learned how programming and technologic world works.
In the future, I will try to connect my basic knowledge into proffesional sports.

Develop in Swift:

Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
It involves writing code in a programming language to build software, automate processes, or solve problems.
Input data refers to information or signals provided to a system for processing, while output data is the result or response generated by the system after processing the input.
Naming and labeling our codes are really important because in this way we can work in an organized and successful way.
Strings are the main thing for forming the program, they put all the codes in the right order so it could work in a perfect way.
Variables are named storage locations that can hold different values during the execution of a program, while constants are similar but hold values that do not change once defined. Variables allow flexibility, whereas constants ensure stability for fixed values.
